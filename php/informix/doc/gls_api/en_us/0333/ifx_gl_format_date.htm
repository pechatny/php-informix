<h2>
ifx_gl_format_date - Format a date value.
<hr></h2>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<pre>
<b>#include &lt;ifxgls.h&gt;
int ifx_gl_format_date(char *datestr,
                       int datebytes, 
                       mi_date *date,
                       char *format)
</b></pre>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This function creates a string from the the mi_date structure pointed
to by <i>date</i> using the format specified by <i>format</i>.  The
resulting string is stored in the buffer pointed to by <i>datestr</i>
and <i>datebytes</i> is the size of the output buffer.

<p>If <i>format</i> is NULL, then the format is
determined from the environment as follows:

<ol>
<li>If the DBDATE environment variable is set, then the date is scanned
according to the order of the format elements in DBDATE.

<li>If the GL_DATE environment variable is set, then the format is scanned according to the specification
of GL_DATE.

<li>Otherwise the d_fmt setting of the current GLS locale is used.
</ol>
<p>
If <i>format</i> is not NULL, then it must point to a string which
follows the rules described in the FORMAT section below.

<h2>FORMAT</h2>

The format is a character string that contains two types of
objects: plain characters, which are simply copied to the output
stream, and conversion specifications which are expanded to
strings representing a date element corresponding to 
the value in <i>date</i>.

<dl>
<dt>%a<dd>
is replaced by the locale's abbreviated weekday name (see the 'abday'
sub-category of the locale's LC_TIME category).
<dt>%A<dd>
is replaced by the locale's full weekday name (see the 'day' sub-category
of the locale's LC_TIME category).
<dt>%b<dd>
is replaced by the locale's abbreviated month name (see the 'abmon' 
sub-category of the locale's LC_TIME category).
<dt>%B<dd>
is replaced by the locale's full month name (see the 'mon' sub-category
of the locale's LC_TIME category).
<dt>%C<dd>
is replaced by the century number (the year divided by 100 
and truncated to an integer as a decimal number
[00-00].
<dt>%d<dd>
is replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number [01,31].
<dt>%D<dd>
is the same as %m/%d/%y.
<dt>%e<dd>
is replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number [1,31]; a single
digit is preceeded by a space.
<dt>%h<dd>
same as %b.
<dt>%j<dd>
is replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number [001,366].
<dt>%m<dd>
is replaced by the month as a decimal number [01,12].
<dt>%n<dd>
is replaced by a newline character.
<dt>%t<dd>
is replaced by a tab character.
<dt>%u<dd>
Is replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [1,7], with 1
representing Monday.
<dt>%w<dd>
is replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [0,6], with 0
representing Sunday.
<dt>%x<dd>
the value of the 'd_fmt' sub-category of the locale's LC_TIME category is 
temporarily used as the format string.
<dt>%y<dd>
is replaced by year without century as a decimal number [00,99].
<dt>%iy<dd>
Is an Informix backward compatibility modifier which formats like the
Informix DBDATE format Y2. This will print the two digit year offset.
<dt>%Y<dd>
is replaced by year with century as a decimal number [00,99].
<dt>%iY<dd>
Is an Informix backward compatibility modifier which formats like the
Informix DBDATE format Y4. This will print the full four digit year.
<dt>%%<dd>
is replaced by %.

</dl>
<p>
If a conversion specification does not correspond to any of the above,
the behavior is undefined.

<h4>Modified Conversion Specifiers</h4>

Some conversion specifiers can be modified by the E or O modifier
characters to indicate that an alternative format or specification
should be used rather than the one normally used by the unmodified
conversion specifier. If the alternative format or specification does
not exist for the current locale, the behavior will be as if unmodified
conversion specifications were used.
<dl>
<dt>%EC<dd>
is replaced by the name of the base year (period) in the locale's
alternative representation (see the 'era' sub-category of the locale's
LC_TIME category).
<dt>%Eg<dd>
is replaced by the abbreviated name of the base year (period) in the locale's
alternative representation (see the 'era' sub-category of the locale's
LC_TIME category).
<dt>%Ex<dd>
the value of the 'era_d_fmt' sub-category of the locale's LC_TIME
category is temporarily used as the format string.
<dt>%Ey<dd>
is replaced by the offset from %EC (year only) in the locale's
alternative representation (see the 'era' sub-category of the locale's
LC_TIME category).
<dt>%EY<dd>
is replaced by the full alternative year representation (see the 'era'
sub-category of the locale's LC_TIME category).
<dt>%Oe<dd>
is replaced by the day of the month, using the locale's alternative
numeric digits, filled as needed with leading spaces.
<dt>%Om<dd>
is replaced by the month using the locale's alternative numeric
digits
<dt>%Ou<dd>
is replaced by the weekday as a number using the locale's alternative
numeric digits (Monday=1).
<dt>%Oy<dd>
is replaced by the value of %Ey using the locale's alternative
numeric digits.

</dl>

<h4>Field Width and Precision</h4>

<p>An optional justification, field width and precision specification can
immediately follow the initial % of a directive according to the
following:

<pre>[-|0][&lt;width&gt;][.&lt;precision&gt;]</pre>

<dl>
<dt>justification<dd>
If the specification begins with a minus (-) then the field will be
left justified and padded with spaces on the right. If the value
begins with a zero (0) then the field will be right justified and
padded with zeros on the left. Otherwise, the value will be right
justified and padded with spaces on the left.

<dt>width<dd>
&lt;width&gt; is a decimal value which specifies a minimum field width for
the conversion and &lt;width&gt; is specified in terms of display width.
&lt;width&gt; is ignored when scanning strings.

<dt>precision<dd>

<p>The field width specifier may be followed by a precision directive
defined to be a period followed by a decimal value.  

<p>For the C, d, e, Ey, iy, iY, j, m, u, w, y and
Y directives, the value of &lt;precision&gt; specifies the minimum number of
digits to appear.  If a directive supplies fewer digits than specified
by the precision, it will be padded with leading zeros.

<p>For the a, A, b, B, EC, Eg, and h, directives, the value of
&lt;precision&gt; specifies the maximum number of characters to be used. If
a value to be formatted has more characters than specified by the
precision, the result will be truncated on the right.

<p>The values of &lt;width&gt; and &lt;precision&gt; do not affect the Ex, 
EY, n, t, x or %.

<p>The values of &lt;width&gt; and &lt;precision&gt; affect each
element of the D directive. For example %6.4D would be
printed as "%6.4m/%6.4d/%6.4y".

<p>For the directives modified with O (Alternate Digits) the field width
and relates to display width rather than actual number of digits. The
precision is still the minimum number of digits printed.

<p>The d, Ey, iy, m, u, w, and y directives have a
default precision of .2.

<p>The j directive has a default precision of 3. 

<p>The Y and iY directives have a default precision of 4.
