                ===================================
                           DEMO PROGRAM NOTES
                                 FOR
                      IBM INFORMIX-LIBCPP on UNIX
                ===================================

I] FILES INCLUDED :
===================
	The current directory contains the LIBCPP samples which demostrate the
	basic funcionality of all the CPP APIs. The files included here are - 

i) Sample CPP programs -
----------------------------
cnvex.cpp
contain.cpp
csql.cpp
csql2.cpp
csql3.cpp
curstst.cpp
cursupd.cpp
deldrv.cpp
delegate.cpp
dtex.cpp
fsexamp1.cpp
ifval.cpp
loadtab.cpp
loex1.cpp
loex2.cpp
queryex.cpp
rawval.cpp
routine.cpp
rowref.cpp
rowset.cpp
seqsetex.cpp
simpval.cpp
sysname.cpp
tabcnt.cpp
testtype.cpp

ii) Input files -
---------------------
	Some of the demos need some input files, in order to run. They are -
csql.inp
csql2.inp
csql3.inp
curstst.inp
loadtab.inp
rowset.inp
testtype1.inp
testtype2.inp

iii) SQL files - 
------------------
cleanup.sql
	- To drop the table and rows from the database.
setup.sql
	- To create the tables and load the rows into the database.

iv) Other support files include - 
-----------------------------------
Makefile
	- To make all the LIBCPP demos.

II]. SETUP :
============
In order to run the LIBCPP demo, the following setup is essential -
	a) Make sure that the INFORMIXDIR is set.
	b) Make sure that CC compiler is in the PATH. 
	c) Make sure that you have a database by the name of the 'user' who 
	   will be running the demos.

III]. COMPILE :
===============
	a) To compile all the demos simply run 'make'.
	b) To compile a specific program run 'make' followed by filename.
		eg. make tabcnt
	   On Windows platform, you may have to use the 'nmake' utility.

IV]. EXECUTION : 
================
	a) Before running any demos make sure that the database is created.
	b) All of the demos need some tables and data loaded into the database
	   to run successfully. This can be done by the following command -
	   csql2 < setup.sql
	c) In order to run any demo, pass the demo name at the command prompt -
	   eg. tabcnt
	   Some of the demos require an input file to run successfully. In such
	   cases, you will need to pass the corresponding input file as the
           argument to the executable - 
	   eg. csql < csql.inp
	d) Once the demos have been run, and you wish to drop the tables and 
           rows, it can be done by using the following command -
	   csql2 < cleanup
	e) The demo programs can be cleaned up by using the following command -
	   'make cleanup'.
