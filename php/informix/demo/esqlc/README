                ===================================
                           DEMO PROGRAM NOTES
                                 FOR
                        INFORMIX-ESQL/C on UNIX
                ===================================

I]. Compile / Execution :

        a. In order to compile any one or all the demos INFORMIXDIR must be set.
        b. To compile all programs run 'make'
        c. To compile a specific program run 'make' followed by filename
                eg. make blobload
        d. To run the demo program, just pass the program name at the command.
                eg. blobload

II]. Some ESQL/C programs require 'stores_demo' database to exist on server
     end. You will need to create the 'stores_demo' by using the
     'dbaccessdemo stores_demo'  or 'dbaccessdemo7 stores_demo' on server end.

III]. CLOB related demo programs require 'superstores_demo' database to exit
      on the server. You can create the 'superstores_demo' by using 
      'dbaccessdemo9' on server.

Following ESQL/C programs require 'superstores_demo' database to exist on server end.
  create_clob.ec
  get_lo_info.ec
  upd_lo_descr.ec

Following ESQL/C programs require 'stores_demo' database to exist on server end.
  blobload.ec
  collect.ec
  demo1.ec
  demo2.ec
  demo3.ec
  demo4.ec
  dispcat_pic.ec
  dyn_sql.ec
  getcd_me.ec
  getcd_nf.ec
  getcd_of.ec
  getdiag.ec
  lvarptr.ec
  pamdemo.ec
  rgetlmsg.ec
  rgetmsg.ec
  risnull.ec
  rsetnull.ec
  rtypalign.ec
  rtypmsize.ec
  rtypname.ec
  rtypwidth.ec
  sqldetachdemo.ec
  timeout.ec
  unload.ec
  updcd_me.ec
  updcd_nf.ec
  updcd_of.ec
  varchar.ec

III]. Example usage for some programs :

blobload :
        blobload -u -f blobload.ec -d stores7 -t catalog -b cat_picture -k catalog_num 10027

IV]. New Demos Added :
  Starting with CSDK2.81.UC2, an extra demo has been added for the PAM 
feature. The demo basically does the same thing as demo1, but has the callback
function in it. When connected to the PAM enabled server, it would prompt the 
user with some challenges, and the user may need to provide appropriate 
responses. 
  The main idea of the demo is to demostrate to the users the use of the
callback function for the PAM feature. 

V]. Cleanup
  The 'make cleanup' option removes all the demo executable and the 
respective 'C' and OBJECT files.
