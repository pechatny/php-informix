OS Information : Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 5.3 (Tikanga)
                 Certified on RHEL 6 and 7, SUSE SLES 11 and 12,
                 Ubuntu Server Edition 8.04, 10.04, 12.04 LTS
                 and 14.04 LTS, Asianux 3 SP3, Debian 5.0,
                 CentOS 6 and 7.

Machine Specific Notes
======================

1. This product was built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES release 5.3
   (Kernel: 2.6.18, Glibc: 2.5.34) for x86_64 compatible processors.
   The following compilers were used:

        gcc and g++ compiler 4.1.2 20080704 (Red Hat 4.1.2-44)

   Installing the product on Ubuntu or Debian requires RPM to be installed
   and initialized. After RPM installed, use the following commands to 
   initialize RPM:

        mkdir -p /var/lib/rpm 
        rpm --initdb

   The bc utility is required by the product installer, and needs to be 
   installed on Ubuntu.

2. If you use the C++ Interface with shared libraries, setting the
   environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

     (for C Shell)
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $INFORMIXDIR/lib:$INFORMIXDIR/lib/esql:
     $INFORMIXDIR/lib/c++:$INFORMIXDIR/lib/dmi:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

     (for Bourne or Korn Shell)
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INFORMIXDIR/lib:$INFORMIXDIR/lib/esql:
     $INFORMIXDIR/lib/c++:$INFORMIXDIR/lib/dmi:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

3. IPv6 Support 

   The product supports Internet Protocol Version 6 (128 Bit Internet Addresses)
   as well as IPv4 (32 Bit Addresses).

   In order for the machine name specified in the SQLHOSTS file to resolve
   to the correct IP address, the name services files on the Operating System
   should be correctly configured. If the machine has IPv6 address configured
   and the listener thread is bound to an IPv6 address, then the name
   resolution files /etc/netsvc.conf should be configured to fetch IPv6
   address. Also use the appropriate /etc/hosts setting if local machine
   settings are used.

   For compatibility with older IBM Informix client and server products,
   assign the same hostname with both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 address.
   If the listener needs to be bound to an IPv4 address and the name services
   resolve the name in the order of the IPv6 address followed by IPv4 address,
   then an explicit IPv4 address needs to be put in nodename field of SQLHOSTS
   file. Client applications should also use the same setting.
